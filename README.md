### Check trained model SuperGLUE metrics

Install [lm-evaluation-harness](https://github.com/bigscience-workshop/lm-evaluation-harness) and run on the `SuperGLUE` metrics: `axb`, `axg`, `boolq`, `cb`, `copa`, `multirc`, `record`, `superglue_rte`, `wic`, and `wsc` (and any other metrics you'd like, of course).
