This passage is adapted from Brian Greene, “How the Higgs
Boson Was Found.” ©2013 by Smithsonian Institution. The
Higgs boson is an elementary particle associated with the
Higgs field. Experiments conducted in 2012–2013
tentatively confirmed the existence of the Higgs boson and
thus of the Higgs field.
