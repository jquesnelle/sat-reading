Passage 1 is adapted from Alexis de Tocqueville, Democracy
in America, Volume 2. Originally published in 1840. Passage 2
is adapted from Harriet Taylor Mill, “Enfranchisement of
Women.” Originally published in 1851. As United States and
European societies grew increasingly democratic during the
nineteenth century, debates arose about whether freedoms
enjoyed by men should be extended to women as well.
