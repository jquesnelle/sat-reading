Which conclusion about the mean mass of guppy embryos is best supported by figure 2?
A) The slope location was a better indicator of mean embryo mass than was the predation level observed in each environment.
B) The mean embryo mass of guppies born in the north slope environments exceeded the mean embryo mass of guppies born in the south slope environments.
*C) The predation level observed in each environment had more of an effect on mean embryo mass than did slope location.
D) The guppies born in the low-predation environments had a mean embryo mass less than that of guppies born in the high-predation environments.
