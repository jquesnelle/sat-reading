    At last, Old Widow Lau was done haggling with
the driver and we stepped inside Father’s shop. It was
north-facing, quite dim inside, and perhaps this was
Line why Father did not see us at first. He was busy with a
customer, a man who was distinguished-looking, like
the scholars of two decades before. The two men
were bent over a glass case, discussing the different
qualities of inksticks. Big Uncle welcomed us and
invited us to be seated. From his formal tone, I knew
he did not recognize who we were. So I called his
name in a shy voice. And he squinted at me, then
laughed and announced our arrival to Little Uncle,
who apologized many times for not rushing over
sooner to greet us. They rushed us to be seated at one
of two tea tables for customers. Old Widow Lau
refused their invitation three times, exclaiming that
my father and uncles must be too busy for visitors.
She made weak efforts to leave. On the fourth
insistence, we finally sat. Then Little Uncle brought
us hot tea and sweet oranges, as well as bamboo
latticework fans with which to cool ourselves.
    I tried to notice everything so I could later tell
GaoLing what I had seen, and tease out her envy. The
floors of the shop were of dark wood, polished and
clean, no dirty footprints, even though this was
during the dustiest part of the summer. And along
the walls were display cases made of wood and glass.
The glass was very shiny and not one pane was
broken. Within those glass cases were our silk
wrapped boxes, all our hard work. They looked so
much nicer than they had in the ink-making studio
at Immortal Heart village.
    I saw that Father had opened several of the boxes.
He set sticks and cakes and other shapes on a silk
cloth covering a glass case that served as a table on
which he and the customer leaned. First he pointed
to a stick with a top shaped like a fairy boat and said
with graceful importance, “Your writing will flow as
smoothly as a keel cutting through a glassy lake.”
He picked up a bird shape: “Your mind will soar into
the clouds of higher thought.” He waved toward a
row of ink cakes embellished with designs of peonies
and bamboo: “Your ledgers will blossom into
abundance while bamboo surrounds your quiet
mind.”
    As he said this, Precious Auntie came back into
mind. I was remembering how she taught me that
everything, even ink, had a purpose and a meaning:
Good ink cannot be the quick kind, ready to pour out
of a bottle. You can never be an artist if your work
comes without effort. That is the problem of modern
ink from a bottle. You do not have to think. You
simply write what is swimming on the top of your
brain. And the top is nothing but pond scum, dead
leaves, and mosquito spawn. But when you push an
inkstick along an inkstone, you take the first step to
cleansing your mind and your heart. You push and
you ask yourself, What are my intentions? What is in
my heart that matches my mind?
    I remembered this, and yet that day in the ink
shop, I listened to what Father was saying, and his
words became far more important than anything
Precious Auntie had thought. “Look here,” Father
said to his customer, and I looked. He held up an
inkstick and rotated it in the light. “See? It’s the right
hue, purple-black, not brown or gray like the cheap
brands you might find down the street. And listen to
this.” And I heard a sound as clean and pure as a
small silver bell. “The high-pitched tone tells you that
the soot is very fine, as smooth as the sliding banks of
old rivers. And the scent—can you smell the balance
of strength and delicacy, the musical notes of the
ink’s perfume? Expensive, and everyone who sees
you using it will know that it was well worth the high
price.”
    I was very proud to hear Father speak of our
family’s ink this way.
