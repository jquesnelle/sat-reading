    Every age and generation must be as free to act for
itself, in all cases, as the ages and generations which
preceded it. The vanity and presumption of
governing beyond the grave, is the most ridiculous
and insolent of all tyrannies.
    Man has no property in man; neither has any
generation a property in the generations which are to
follow. The Parliament or the people of 1688, or of
any other period, had no more right to dispose of the
people of the present day, or to bind or to control
them in any shape whatever, than the parliament or
the people of the present day have to dispose of, bind,
or control those who are to live a hundred or a
thousand years hence.
    Every generation is, and must be, competent
to all the purposes which its occasions require. It is
the living, and not the dead, that are to be
accommodated. When man ceases to be, his power
and his wants cease with him; and having no longer
any participation in the concerns of this world, he
has no longer any authority in directing who shall be
its governors, or how its government shall be
organized, or how administered....
    Those who have quitted the world, and those who
are not yet arrived at it, are as remote from each
other, as the utmost stretch of mortal imagination
can conceive. What possible obligation, then, can
exist between them; what rule or principle can be laid
down, that two nonentities, the one out of existence,
and the other not in, and who never can meet in this
world, that the one should control the other to the
end of time?...
    The circumstances of the world are continually
changing, and the opinions of men change also; and
as government is for the living, and not for the dead,
it is the living only that has any right in it. That
which may be thought right and found convenient in
one age, may be thought wrong and found
inconvenient in another. In such cases, who is to
decide, the living, or the dead?
