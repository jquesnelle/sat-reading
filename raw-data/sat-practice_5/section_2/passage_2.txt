    The investigation of the rights of the slave has led
me to a better understanding of my own. I have
found the Anti-Slavery cause to be the high school of
morals in our land—the school in which human
rights are more fully investigated, and better
understood and taught, than in any other. Here a
great fundamental principle is uplifted and
illuminated, and from this central light, rays
innumerable stream all around.
    Human beings have rights, because they are moral
beings: the rights of all men grow out of their moral
nature; and as all men have the same moral nature,
they have essentially the same rights. These rights
may be wrested from the slave, but they cannot be
alienated: his title to himself is as perfect now, as is
that of Lyman Beecher:1 it is stamped on his moral
being, and is, like it, imperishable. Now if rights are
founded in the nature of our moral being, then the
mere circumstance of sex does not give to man higher
rights and responsibilities, than to woman. To
suppose that it does, would be to deny the
self-evident truth, that the “physical constitution is
the mere instrument of the moral nature.” To
suppose that it does, would be to break up utterly the
relations, of the two natures, and to reverse their
functions, exalting the animal nature into a monarch,
and humbling the moral into a slave; making the
former a proprietor, and the latter its property.
   When human beings are regarded as moral
beings, sex, instead of being enthroned upon the
summit, administering upon rights and
responsibilities, sinks into insignificance and
nothingness. My doctrine then is, that whatever it is
morally right for man to do, it is morally right for
woman to do. Our duties originate, not from
difference of sex, but from the diversity of our
relations in life, the various gifts and talents
committed to our care, and the different eras in
which we live.
