How does the graph support the authorâ€™s point that internal waves affect ocean water dynamics?
*A) It demonstrates that wave movement forces warmer water down to depths that typically are colder.
B) It reveals the degree to which an internal wave affects the density of deep layers of cold water.
C) It illustrates the change in surface temperature that takes place during an isolated series of deep waves.
D) It shows that multiple waves rising near the surface of the ocean disrupt the flow of normal tides.
