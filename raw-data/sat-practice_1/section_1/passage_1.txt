    Akira came directly, breaking all tradition. Was
that it? Had he followed form—had he asked his
mother to speak to his father to approach a
go-between—would Chie have been more receptive?
    He came on a winter’s eve. He pounded on the
door while a cold rain beat on the shuttered veranda,
so at first Chie thought him only the wind. The maid
knew better. Chie heard her soft scuttling footsteps,
the creak of the door. Then the maid brought a
calling card to the drawing room, for Chie.
    Chie was reluctant to go to her guest; perhaps she
was feeling too cozy. She and Naomi were reading at
a low table set atop a charcoal brazier. A thick quilt
spread over the sides of the table so their legs were
tucked inside with the heat.
    “Who is it at this hour, in this weather?” Chie
questioned as she picked the name card off the
maid’s lacquer tray.
    “Shinoda, Akira. Kobe Dental College,” she read.
    Naomi recognized the name. Chie heard a soft
intake of air.
    “I think you should go,” said Naomi.
    Akira was waiting in the entry. He was in his early
twenties, slim and serious, wearing the black
military-style uniform of a student. As he
bowed—his hands hanging straight down, a
black cap in one, a yellow oil-paper umbrella in the
other—Chie glanced beyond him. In the glistening
surface of the courtyard’s rain-drenched paving
stones, she saw his reflection like a dark double.
    “Madame,” said Akira, “forgive my disruption,
but I come with a matter of urgency.”
    His voice was soft, refined. He straightened and
stole a deferential peek at her face.
    In the dim light his eyes shone with sincerity.
Chie felt herself starting to like him.
    “Come inside, get out of this nasty night. Surely
your business can wait for a moment or two.”
    “I don’t want to trouble you. Normally I would
approach you more properly but I’ve received word
of a position. I’ve an opportunity to go to America, as
dentist for Seattle’s Japanese community.”
    “Congratulations,” Chie said with amusement.
“That is an opportunity, I’m sure. But how am I
involved?”
    Even noting Naomi’s breathless reaction to the
name card, Chie had no idea. Akira’s message,
delivered like a formal speech, filled her with
maternal amusement. You know how children speak
so earnestly, so hurriedly, so endearingly about
things that have no importance in an adult’s mind?
That’s how she viewed him, as a child.
    It was how she viewed Naomi. Even though
Naomi was eighteen and training endlessly in the arts
needed to make a good marriage, Chie had made no
effort to find her a husband.
    Akira blushed.
    “Depending on your response, I may stay in
Japan. I’ve come to ask for Naomi’s hand.”
    Suddenly Chie felt the dampness of the night.
    “Does Naomi know anything of your...
ambitions?”
    “We have an understanding. Please don’t judge
my candidacy by the unseemliness of this proposal. I
ask directly because the use of a go-between takes
much time. Either method comes down to the same
thing: a matter of parental approval. If you give your
consent, I become Naomi’s yoshi.* We’ll live in the
House of Fuji. Without your consent, I must go to
America, to secure a new home for my bride.”
    Eager to make his point, he’d been looking her full
in the face. Abruptly, his voice turned gentle. “I see
I’ve startled you. My humble apologies. I’ll take no
more of your evening. My address is on my card. If
you don’t wish to contact me, I’ll reapproach you in
two weeks’ time. Until then, good night.”
    He bowed and left. Taking her ease, with effortless
grace, like a cat making off with a fish.
    “Mother?” Chie heard Naomi’s low voice and
turned from the door. “He has asked you?”
    The sight of Naomi’s clear eyes, her dark brows
gave Chie strength. Maybe his hopes were
preposterous.
    “Where did you meet such a fellow? Imagine! He
thinks he can marry the Fuji heir and take her to
America all in the snap of his fingers!”
    Chie waited for Naomi’s ripe laughter.
    Naomi was silent. She stood a full half minute
looking straight into Chie’s eyes. Finally, she spoke.
“I met him at my literary meeting.”
    Naomi turned to go back into the house, then
stopped.
    “Mother.”
    “Yes?”
    “I mean to have him.”
