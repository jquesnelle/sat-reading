This passage is adapted from Thor Hanson, Feathers.
Â©2011 by Thor Hanson. Scientists have long debated how
the ancestors of birds evolved the ability to fly. The
ground-up theory assumes they were fleet-footed ground
dwellers that captured prey by leaping and flapping their
upper limbs. The tree-down theory assumes they were tree
climbers that leapt and glided among branches.
