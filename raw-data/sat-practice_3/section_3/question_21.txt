Which choice best reflects the overall sequence of events in the passage?
A) An experiment is proposed but proves unworkable; a less ambitious experiment is attempted, and it yields data that give rise to a new set of questions.
B) A new discovery leads to reconsideration of a theory; a classic study is adapted, and the results are summarized.
C) An anomaly is observed and simulated experimentally; the results are compared with previous findings, and a novel hypothesis is proposed.
*D) An unexpected finding arises during the early phase of a study; the study is modified in response to this finding, and the results are interpreted and evaluated.
