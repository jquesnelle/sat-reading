Do the data in the table provide support for the authors’ claim that infection with varroa mites increases a honeybee’s susceptibility to secondary infections?
A) Yes, because the data provide evidence that infection with a pathogen caused the colonies to undergo colony collapse disorder.
B) Yes, because for each pathogen, the percent of colonies infected is greater for colonies with colony collapse disorder than for colonies without colony collapse disorder.
C) No, because the data do not provide evidence about bacteria as a cause of colony collapse disorder.
*D) No, because the data do not indicate whether the honeybees had been infected with mites.
