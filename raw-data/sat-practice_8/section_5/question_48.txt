Which choice describes a scenario in which Hodick and Sievers’s model predicts that a Venus flytrap will NOT close around an insect?
A) A large insect’s second contact with the plant’s trigger hairs results in a total calcium ion concentration above the trap’s threshold.
*B) A large insect makes contact with a second trigger hair after a period of inactivity during which calcium ion concentrations have diminished appreciably.
C) A large insect’s contact with the plant’s trigger hairs causes calcium channels to open in the trap.
D) A large insect’s contact with a second trigger hair occurs within ten seconds of its contact with the first trigger hair.
