B) They increased the presence of 1,4-dimethoxybenzene only during the August flowering season.
C) They compared the gourds that developed from naturally pollinated flowers to the gourds that developed from hand-pollinated flowers.
*D) They gave bees a chance to choose between beetle-free enhanced flowers and beetle-free normal flowers.
